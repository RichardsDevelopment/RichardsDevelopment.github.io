## Welcome to my GitHub page!

My name is Eric Richards and I am a Computer Science student at Southern New Hampshire University. Over the last two years I have done quite a bit of programming and have developed a passion for it! These are just a couple of the projects I have undertaken, so check back regularly for updates and news regarding upcoming releases.

# Code Review

In this video I identify the strengths and weaknesses of the code I chose to represent my strengths in Software Design and Engineering, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Databases. This is shown through two programs: D20Chat and BidTracker. I also my plans for future changes regarding these programs.

# Software Engineering and Design

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/RichardsDevelopment/RichardsDevelopment.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/RichardsDevelopment/RichardsDevelopment.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
