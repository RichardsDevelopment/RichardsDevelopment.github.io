# Welcome to my GitHub page!

My name is Eric Richards and I am a Computer Science student at Southern New Hampshire University. Over the last two years I have done quite a bit of programming and have developed a passion for it! These are just a couple of the projects I have undertaken, so check back regularly for updates and news regarding upcoming releases.

## Code Review

In this video I identify the strengths and weaknesses of the code I chose to represent my strengths in Software Design and Engineering, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Databases. This is shown through two programs: D20Chat and BidTracker. I also my plans for future changes regarding these programs.

## Software Engineering and Design

### 1. Choice

The artifact I chose to represent my skills in terms of software engineering and design is my D20Chat program. It is a simple web application used by tabletop gamers to communicate in different in-game languages. This keeps the game immersive and personal. This is a project I worked on about two years ago as an introduction to web development and Node.js, and I am proud of it!

### 2. Justification/ Skills Used

As a show of my skills, I believe this is one of the most complete artifacts I have. It shows my use of external libraries, object-oriented programming, and full-stack web development. I used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL to create it, as well as Linux commands while I set up my online server. It was very messy when I started work, but I have added comments for every section of code and cleaned the organization of the program.  This was my plan from the beginning, but I have found additional things I would like to work on. When I created the server-side JavaScript, I had very little knowledge of creating server scripts, and I used global variables for things that will have to be done for each logged-in user. This can cause all kinds of errors, so I would like to turn these into class variables for the sockets. This is an easy process but will take some time to refactor the code. 

### 3. Reflection

While enhancing the code, I realized how much easier code is to read with accurate comments! Most programs that I’ve written have been small and comments were forsaken, which was a big mistake. In reorganizing the code, I also realized how much easier it was to find something when it is organized! Clean code is good code, and I need to keep this in mind moving forward.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/RichardsDevelopment/RichardsDevelopment.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/RichardsDevelopment/RichardsDevelopment.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
